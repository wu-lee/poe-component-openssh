NAME
    POE::Component::OpenSSH - Nonblocking SSH Component for POE using
    Net::OpenSSH

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    Need nonblocking SSH? You like Net::OpenSSH? Try out this stuff right
    here.

        use POE::Component::OpenSSH;

        my $ssh = POE::Component::OpenSSH->new( args => [ $host, user => $user ] );

        # perhaps using verbose, debug?
        my $ssh = POE::Component::OpenSSH->new(
            args    => [ $host, user => 'root', passwd => $pass ],
            verbose => 1, # turns on POE::Component::Generic verbose
            debug   => 1, # turns on POE::Component::Generic debug
        );

        # now set up events
        $ssh->
        ...

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to use SSH (via Net::OpenSSH) in a nonblocking
    manner.

    I kept having to write this small thing each time I needed nonblocking
    SSH in a project. I got tired of it so I wrote this instead.

    Why put the args in an "args" attribute instead of straight away
    attributes? Because Net::OpenSSH has a lot of options and they may
    collide with POE::Component::Generic's options, and I don't feel like
    maintaining the mess.

    It's on Github so you can patch it up if you want (I accept patches...
    and foodstamps).
